><p><h3>Why use spring boot and other technologies </h3>
#
>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone,
> production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
>We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss.
 >Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.
>If youâ€™re looking for information about a specific version
 >or instructions about how to upgrade from an earlier release,
 >check out the project release notes section on our wiki.></p>
